## KJ 6.3

*A chemical manufacturing process for a pharmaceutical product was discussed in Sec. 1.4. In this problem, the objective is to understand the relationship between biological measurements of the raw materials (predictors), measurements of the manufacturing process (predictors), and the response of product yield. Biological predictors cannot be changed but can be used to assess the quality of the raw material before processing. On the other hand, manufacturing process predictors can be changed in the manufacturing process. Improving product yield by 1% will boost revenue by approximately one hundred thousand dollars per batch ($100,000/batch):*

### (a) 

*Start R and use these commands to load the data:*

*The matrix `processPredictors` contains the 57 predictors (12 describing the input of biological material and 45 describing the process predictors) for the 176 manufacturing runs. `yield` contains the percent yield for each run.*

```{r}
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
data(ChemicalManufacturingProcess)
df_raw <- ChemicalManufacturingProcess
```

### b. 

*A small percentage of cells in the predictor set contain missing values. Use the imputation function to fill in these missing values (e.g., see Sec. 3.8).*

```{r}
summary(df_raw)
paste0("Missing Values: ",sum(is.na(ChemicalManufacturingProcess)))
```

```{r fig.height=10}
gg_miss_var(df_raw)
```

```{r}
preProcess_NAdata_model <- preProcess(df_raw, method ="medianImpute")
df <- predict(preProcess_NAdata_model, newdata = df_raw)
```

```{r}
paste0(sum(is.na(df))," values missing after imputation")
```

### c.

*Split the data into a training and test set, pre-process the data, and tune a model of your choice from this chapter. What is the optimal value of the performance metric?*  

**Code References: https://topepo.github.io/caret/pre-processing.html#the-preprocess-function** 

#### Splitting data in to training and test set

```{r}
# Create the training and test datasets
set.seed(100)

# Step 1: Get row numbers for the training data
trainRowNumbers <- createDataPartition(df$Yield, p=0.8, list=FALSE)

# Step 2: Create the training  dataset
trainData <- df[trainRowNumbers,]

# Step 3: Create the test dataset
testData <- df[-trainRowNumbers,]
```

#### Data preprocess

```{r}
preProcValues <- preProcess(trainData, method = c("center", "scale"))

trainTransformed <- predict(preProcValues, trainData)
testTransformed <- predict(preProcValues, testData)

trainTransformed

xTrain <- trainTransformed %>% dplyr::select(-Yield)

yTrain <- trainTransformed %>% dplyr::select(Yield)
```

#### Tune model

```{r warning=FALSE}
lm_model <- train(xTrain, yTrain$Yield, method="lm", trControl=trainControl(method="repeatedcv",repeats=5) )
lm_model
```

```{r}
summary(lm_model)

plot(lm_model$finalModel)
```

### d. 

**Resampling examples from Sect. 4.9 of the text.**

*Predict the response for the test set. What is the value of the performance metric and how does this compare with the resampled performance metric of the training set?*

### e.

*Which predictors are the most important in the model you have trained? Do either the biological or process predictors dominate the list?*

### f. 

*Explore the relationships between each of the top predictors and the response. How could this information be helpful in improving yield in the future runs of the manufacturing process?*

## KJ 7.2 (Nonlinear Regression Models)
**Friedman (1991) introduced several benchmark data sets create by simulation. One of these simulations used the following nonlinear equation to create data:**
$$
y = 10\sin(\pi x_1x_2) + 20(x_3 - 0.5)^2 + 10x_4 + 5x_5 + N(0, \sigma)
$$

**where the** $x$ **values are random variables uniformly distributed between [0,1] (there are also 5 other non-informative variables also created in the simulation). The package** $mlbench$ **contains a function called** $mlbench.friedman1$ ** that simulates these data:**

```{r results='hide', fig.width=12}
library(mlbench)
set.seed(200)
trainingData <- mlbench.friedman1(200, sd = 1)
## We convert the 'x' data from a matrix to a data frame
## One reason is that this will give the columns names.
trainingData$x <- data.frame(trainingData$x)
## Look at the data using
featurePlot(trainingData$x, trainingData$y)
## or other methods.

## This creates a list with a vector 'y' and a matrix
## of predictors 'x'. Also simulate a large test set to
## estimate the true error rate with good precision:
testData <- mlbench.friedman1(5000, sd = 1)
testData$x <- data.frame(testData$x)
```

Tune several models on these data. For example:

```{r results='hide'}
library(caret)
knnModel <- train(x = trainingData$x,
                   y = trainingData$y,
                   method = "knn",
                   preProc = c("center", "scale"),
                   tuneLength = 10)
knnModel
```

```{r}
knnPred <- predict(knnModel, newdata = testData$x)
## The function 'postResample' can be used to get the test set
## perforamnce values
postResample(pred = knnPred, obs = testData$y)
```

**Which models appear to give the best performance? Does MARS select the informative predictors (those named** $X1-X5$**)?**


\newpage


## KJ 7.5 (Nonlinear Regression Models)

**Exercise 6.3 describes data for a chemical manufacturing process. Use the same data imputation, data splitting, and pre-processing steps as before and train several nonlinear regression models.**

### a. Which nonlinear regression model gives the optimal resampling and test set performance?


### b. Which predictors are most important in the optimal nonlinear regression model? Do either the biological or process variables dominate the list? How do the top ten important predictors compare to the top ten predictors from the optimal linear model?



### c. Explore the relationships between the top predictors and the response for the predictors that are unique to the optimal nonlinear regression model. Do these plots reveal intuition about the biological or process predictors and their relationship with yield?



\newpage

## KJ 8.1 (Regression Trees and Rule-Based Models)

**Recreate the simulated data from Exercise 7.2:**

```{r}
library(mlbench)
set.seed(200)
simulated <- mlbench.friedman1(200, sd = 1)
simulated <- cbind(simulated$x, simulated$y)
simulated <- as.data.frame(simulated)
colnames(simulated)[ncol(simulated)] <- "y"
head(simulated)
```

### a. Fit a random forest model to all of the predictors, then estimate the variable importance scores:

```{r}
#library(randomForest)
#library(caret)
library(tibble)
model1 <- randomForest(y ~., data = simulated, importance = TRUE, ntree = 1000)
rfImp1 <- varImp(model1, scale = FALSE)

rfImp1 <- tibble::rownames_to_column(rfImp1, "Predictors")

rfImp1 %>%
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(Predictors, Overall)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = Overall)) +
    geom_segment(aes(x=Predictors, xend=Predictors, y=min(Overall), yend= Overall), color = "grey") +
    geom_point(color = "orange", size = 4) +
    xlab("Predictor") +
    theme_light() +
    coord_flip()
```

Did the random forest model significantly use the uninformative predictors (V6-V10)?



### b. Now add an additional predictor that is highly correlated with one of the informative predictors. For example:

```{}
> simulated$duplicate1 <- simulated$V1 + rnorm(200) * .1
> cor(simulated$duplicate1, simulated$V1)
```

Fit another random forest model to these data. Did the importance score for $V1$ change?

What happens when you add another predictor that is also highly correlated with $V1$?




### c. Use the `cforest` function in the `party` package to fit a random forest model using conditional inference trees. The `party` package function `varimp` can calculate predictor importance. The `conditional` argument of that function toggles between the traditional importance measure and the modified version described in `Strobl et al. (2007)`. Do these importances show the same pattern as the traditional random forest model?



### d. Repeat this process with different tree models, such as boosted trees and Cubist. Does the same pattern occur?

## KJ 8.7 (Regression Trees and Rule-Based Models)

**In stochastic gradient boosting the bagging fraction and learning rate will govern the construction of the trees as they are guided by the gradient. Althouth the optimal values of these paramaters should be obtained through the tuning process, it is helpful to understand how the magnitudes of these parameters affect magnitudes of variable importance. Figure 8.24 provides the variable importance plots for boosting using two extreme values for the bagging fraction (0.1 and 0.9) and the learning rate (0.1 and 0.9) for the solubility data. The left-hand plot has both parameters set to 0.1, and the right-hand plot has both set to 0.9:**

### a. Why does the model on the right focus its importance on just the first few of predictors, whereas the model on the left spreads importance across more predictors?


### b. Which model do you think would be more predictive of other samples?


### c. How would increasing interaction depth affect the slope of predictor importance for either model in Fig. 8.24?

# Week 6

## HW BATCH #2 - Market Basket Analysis / Recommender Systems (a simple problem)

**I am assigning one simple problem on market basket analysis / recommender systems.**

**Imagine 10000 receipts sitting on your table. Each receipt represents a transcation with items that were purchased. The receipt is a representation of stuff that went into a customer's basket - and therefore 'Market Basket Analysis'.**

**That is exactly what the Groceries Data Set contains: a collection of receipts with each line representing 1 receipt and the items purchased. Each line is called a** $$transaction$$ **and each column in a row represents an** $item.$

**Here is the dataset =**[GroceryDataSet.csv](https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-8461316-dt-announcement-rid-389564218_1/xid-389564218_1)**(comma separated file)**

**You assignment is to use R to mine the data for association rules. You should report support confidence and lift and your top 10 rules by lift. Turn in as you would the other problems from HA and KJ. You should packaged this with your HW#2 set.**

**NOTE: Bonus - Use a Python Library in addition to R and get a Bonus.**

### 1. Introduction

The database contains customer transactions, 1000 receipts, that will be analyzed to predict customer's shopping trends and potentially provide bundle product recommendations with a more attractive price offer than buying the products individually.

For example, information can be extracted on consumer behavior like *If someone buys coffee and creamer, then is likely to buy cookies with high probability".



### 2. Required Libraries (Python and RMarkdown)

Load some libraries and import data.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Load required R language libraries
require(tidyverse)    # data manipulation
require(arules)       # mining association rules and frequent itemsets
require(arulesViz)    # visualization techniques for association rules
require(RColorBrewer) # graphics color
library(reticulate)   # R interface to Python
```


```{r}
#Installing Python Packages 
py_install("pandas")
```


### 3. Load Dataset (Python) 

Loading the data set with python function, `pandas:read_csv method`. The data represents transaction data from a point of sales system on customer data.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
groc = pd.read_csv("GroceryDataSet.csv", header=None)
# Load data from a CSV file and hide the header
print("\nReading the CSV file (without header)...\n", groc.head(10))
```


With the python function, `pandas:shape method`, view a tuple representing the dimensions of a object:
```{python}
groc.shape
```

... has 9835 observations (rows) recorded for 32 (columns) variables.


View the data frame summary information.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Explore the data structure with an R function
skimr::skim_without_charts(py$groc)
```


### 4. Convert to a Transactional Dataset - Market Basket Analysis using R

Convert data frame to a class `transactions` for perform association mining as follows:
```{r}
#Read the data as transactions class
grocery <- read.transactions("GroceryDataSet.csv", sep = ",", rm.duplicates = TRUE)
```


#### Transaction object
```{r}
grocery
```


#### Summary 
```{r}
summary(grocery)
```


### 5. Data Analysis with Visualizations


Plots showing transactions object most frequent, absolute and relative, items in the data set.

Transactions expressed as a whole number ...
```{r}
#Checking top 20 items sold in the dataset
itemFrequencyPlot(grocery,topN=20,type="absolute",col=brewer.pal(7,'Greens'),space=(0.5),width=(0.5),xlab="Item Name",ylab="Frequency(absolute)",main="Absolute Item Frequency Plot")
```


Transactions expressed as a percentage ...
```{r}
#Again checking top 20 items sold in the given dataset with type=relative
itemFrequencyPlot(grocery,topN=20,type="relative",col=brewer.pal(8,'Spectral'),space=(0.5),width=(0.5),xlab="Item Name",ylab="Frequency(relative)",main="Relative Item Frequency Plot")
```

*Observation:* Whole milk is the best selling product, followed by other vegetables. 


### 6. Apriori Algorithm

**Association Rules**

The associated rules explain the relationship of:
\n $$ \left\{ antecedent \right \} \rightarrow \left\{ consequent \right \}$$


In the analysts, association rules is a data mining measures to compared the relationship between items using these metrics: (1) support, (2) confidence, and (3) lift.

*Support* - refers to the popularity of a single item, based on how frequently customers buy it compared to other products.

*Confidence* - refers to how often customers purchase tow products in an item set. 

*Lift* - refers to the likelihood that a customer will purchase the first and second item together in a set. 


#### Training the algorithm

Train the selected algorithm (Apriori)
```{r}
#Training apriori algorithm on dataset
rules <- apriori(data=grocery,parameter=list(support=0.001,confidence=0.9, minlen= 2, maxlen=10, target = "rules"))
```


The `association rules` metrics settings will find frequent itemsets that satisfies `0.1% Support, 90% Confidence, and Maximum of number of items at 10`.

The total number of rule is 129, with a minimum purchase of 2 item and maximum is 10.


```{r}
summary(rules) # This gives set of rules generated here it is 129, number of transactions, support and confidence values that we have given in previous code
```
* Set of rules: 129.
* Rule length distribution (LHS + RHS): 10 rules with a length of 3 items; 57 rules with a length of 4 items; 56 rules with a length of 5 items; 6 rules with a length of 6 items.
* Summary of quality measures: min, max, median, mean and quantile values for support, confidence and lift.
* Mining info: number of transactions, support-threshold and confidence-threshold.


*Inspect the top 10 rules we obtained and sorted by confidence:*

The `lhs` represents items already taken in a basket, `rhs` represents items frequently taken together along with purchased items. 

```{r}
#visualize the results
inspect(sort(rules, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)[1:10]) 
#`high-confidence' rules
# show the support, lift and confidence for the first 10 rules
```


*Confidence Interpretation:* The rules with confidence of 1 (`see rules_conf` above) imply that, whenever the LHS item is purchased, the RHS item was purchased 100% of the time. Popular items that are derive from this analysis are: **{rice, sugar} with {whole milk}** and **{canned fish, hygiene articles} with {whole milk}**.




*Inspect the top 10 rules we obtained and sorted by lift:*

The recommendation is based on historical preference and ratings to find similarities between users and items.

```{r}
#visualize the results
inspect(sort(rules, by="lift", decreasing=TRUE)[1:10]) 
#`high-confidence' rules
# show the support, lift and confidence for the first 10 rules
```


*Lift Interpretation:* A rule with a lift count (`see rules_lift` above) imply that, the items in LHS and RHS are `n times` more likely to be purchased together compared to the purchases when they are assumed to be unrelated. For example, **{liquor, red/blush wine} paired with {bottled beer}** has a high support and confidence threshold as a bundled transactional sale. 

**Interpretation of Rules sorted by LIFT**
* 90% of the customers who purchased `butter, cream cheese, root vegetables` also purchased `yogurt` is `7 times` more likely to purchase the itemset as a bundle sale.
* 100% of the customers who purchased `brown bread, pip fruit, whipped/sour cream` also purchased `other vegetables` is `5 times` more likely to purchase the itemset as a bundle sale.


#### Visualizing association rules

**Matrix**

Plot showing the measure of interestingness. The default reordering average measure (typically lift) pushes the rules with the highest lift value to the top-left corner of the plot.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sel <- subset(rules, lift>6)
plot(sel, method="matrix", measure="lift")
```


**A Grouped Matrix of association rules**

Plot showing group matrix-based visualization. Antecedents (columns) in the matrix are grouped using clustering.  The most interesting item in the group (highest support in the group to support in all rules): liquor, red/blush wine.
```{r}
plot(rules, method="grouped", control = list(k = 10))
```


```{}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("Rgraphviz")
```

**A Graph model**

Visualize the `10 rules` (or itemsets) as a graph with items as labeled vertices, and rules (or itemsets) represented as vertices connected to items using arrows. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(rules[1:5], method = "graph")
```



```{r warning=FALSE, message=TRUE}
plot(rules[1:10], method = 'graph', control = list(type = "itemsets", col=brewer.pal(6, 'Dark2')))
```
